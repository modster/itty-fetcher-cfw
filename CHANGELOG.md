## Changelog
Until this library makes it to a production release of v1.x, **minor versions may contain breaking changes to the API**.  After v1.x, semantic versioning will be honored, and breaking changes will only occur under the umbrella of a major version bump.

- **v0.8.0** - adds StatusError class (and status to thrown !response.ok Errors), and handleResponse fetcher option.
- **v0.7.3** - better content-type-checking [@danawoodman](https://github.com/danawoodman)
- **v0.7.0** - adds fetch config option for using non-native fetch libraries - [@danawoodman](https://github.com/danawoodman), blob support [@danawoodman](https://github.com/danawoodman) and [@kwhitley](https://github.com/kwhitley)
- **v0.6.0** - adds the ability to handle FormData payloads - [@danawoodman](https://github.com/danawoodman), yet again :)
- **v0.5.0** - adds the transformRequest base config option for transforming requests before the final fetch (use to add headers, etc) - [@danawoodman](https://github.com/danawoodman)
- **v0.4.0** - now does *not* require a fully-qualified URL (as base+path), to properly mirror native fetch
- **v0.3.0** - support for URLSearchParams (or raw object) as payload param for GET requests, and vitest as runner - huge thanks to [@danawoodman](https://github.com/danawoodman)!
- **v0.2.4** - type fix - [@danawoodman](https://github.com/danawoodman)
- **v0.2.3** - fixed content-type headers not being properly injected if headers are sent with fetch options
- **v0.2.0** - adds TS generic to capture Promise response type (e.g. fetcher().get<MyType>('https://foo.bar.baz'))
- **v0.1.0** - first public release
